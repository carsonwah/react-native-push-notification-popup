## Features

- Support "pan" gesture
- Support "onPress" gesture feedback
- Written in pure-JS using official react-native `Animation` package
    - *Which means it supports all Expo/CRNA apps*
- Support iPhone X, XS, Max (yeah that notch)
- Support Android native "elevation"

## Motivations

[Blog post](https://medium.com/@carsonwah/show-push-notification-popup-in-react-native-19db965a5603)

1. In some apps, you may just want to display reminders to user, without going through those troublesome push notification setups
2. Expo/CNRA apps [cannot display push notification while app is in foreground](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v27.0.0/guides/push-notifications#notification-handling-timing)
3. Even if you eject, you still need to configure [iOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14872088/get-push-notification-while-app-in-foreground-ios) and [Android](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38451235/how-to-handle-the-fire-base-notification-when-app-is-in-foreground) separately with native codes

This package is here to help. Just show your own notification popup to your users!

## Installation

```bash
# yarn, recommended
yarn add react-native-push-notification-popup

# or npm
npm install react-native-push-notification-popup --save
```

## Usage

### Declare Component

Put it in a wrapper component. (Maybe where you handle your incoming push notifications)

```javascript
import NotificationPopup from 'react-native-push-notification-popup';

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <MaybeYourNavigator />
        <NotificationPopup ref={ref => this.popup = ref} />
      </View>
    );
  }
// ...
```

> **IMPORTANT**: Remember to put it on the **bottom of other components**, because React render from back to front in order of declaration. We do not use `zIndex` becuase it is [problematic on Android](https://github.com/carsonwah/react-native-push-notification-popup/issues/21).

#### Optional: Customize your popup

```javascript
// Render function
const renderCustomPopup = ({ appIconSource, appTitle, timeText, title, body }) => (
  <View>
    <Text>{title}</Text>
    <Text>{body}</Text>
    <Button title='My button' onPress={() => console.log('Popup button onPress!')} />
  </View>
);

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <NotificationPopup
            ref={ref => this.popup = ref}
            renderPopupContent={renderCustomPopup}
            shouldChildHandleResponderStart={true}
            shouldChildHandleResponderMove={true} />
        </View>
      );
    }
// ...
```

### Show it!

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  this.popup.show({
    onPress: function() {console.log('Pressed')},
    appIconSource: require('./assets/icon.jpg'),
    appTitle: 'Some App',
    timeText: 'Now',
    title: 'Hello World',
    body: 'This is a sample message.\nTesting emoji ðŸ˜€',
    slideOutTime: 5000
  });
}
```
